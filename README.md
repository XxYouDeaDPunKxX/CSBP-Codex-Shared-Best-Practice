# 🧭 Codex Shared Best Practice (CSBP)

CSBP is a lightweight three-file protocol kit for keeping recurring Codex best practices explicit, reviewed, and separate from automatic memory or `AGENTS.md`.

It is not a memory that writes itself.

It is a review gate for practices that may deserve to persist.

## 🚀 Start here

Long-lived Codex setups usually fail in two opposite ways:

- useful guidance stays buried in chat history
- useful guidance gets promoted too quickly into `AGENTS.md`

A third failure mode is worse: automatic persistence.

Session residue, operator preferences, one-off fixes, and rough observations can start shaping future behavior without enough review.

CSBP does the opposite.

It gives Codex a controlled middle layer:

- 🧠 below operator instruction
- 📌 below `AGENTS.md`
- 🗂️ below local project instructions
- 🧾 separate from chat history
- ✋ controlled by the operator

CSBP is for recurring operational practices that are strong enough to reuse, but not strong enough to become host contract.

## 🪶 Lightweight by design

CSBP has no background writer.

During normal runtime, it only loads:

1. `CSBP-entry-point.txt`
2. `shared-best-practice.txt`

The compiler is not active unless the operator asks to form, revise, promote, deprecate, or remove a practice.

That keeps the layer light:

- no automatic memory capture
- no silent rule creation
- no background promotion
- no runtime writes by default
- no practice changes without operator approval

Codex may propose.

The compiler may evaluate.

The operator decides.

The runtime file changes only after approval.

You can also maintain `shared-best-practice.txt` manually by following the documented block shape and promotion rules.

## 🧩 The three files

CSBP is intentionally small.

| File | Role | When it is read |
|---|---|---|
| 🚪 `CSBP-entry-point.txt` | Bootstrap and routing layer. Defines what CSBP is, authority order, usage modes, read order, and write restrictions. | First, every session. |
| 📌 `shared-best-practice.txt` | Runtime layer. Stores promoted practices only. Active practices may guide work when relevant. | After entry point. |
| 🧪 `shared-best-practice-compiler.txt` | Formation layer. Evaluates, normalizes, promotes, revises, deprecates, removes, or rejects candidate practices. | Only when the operator opens practice formation or maintenance work. |

The split matters.

The runtime layer applies approved practices.

The compiler layer decides whether a new or revised practice deserves to exist.

Those jobs must not collapse into each other.

## 🧱 Install

Recommended layout:

```text
.codex/
  memories/
    CSBP-entry-point.txt
    shared-best-practice.txt
    shared-best-practice-compiler.txt
```

Wire `CSBP-entry-point.txt` into your `.codex/AGENTS.md` so a fresh Codex session reads it before using CSBP.

The exact bootstrap line depends on your host environment contract.


## 🎯 What CSBP controls

CSBP controls persistence of recurring operational practice.

It is built for patterns like:

- the same mistake keeps appearing across sessions
- Codex repeatedly misses the same verification step
- a useful working default keeps being rediscovered
- an environment-level constraint should be remembered
- a recurring operational correction should be available without rewriting `AGENTS.md`

A valid CSBP practice should be:

- recurring
- actionable
- preventive
- broader than one project or one session
- compatible with higher-authority instructions
- short enough to apply during real work

It should tell Codex what to do by default, and what recurring wrong pattern to avoid.

## 🔄 Runtime behavior

During normal work, CSBP does not create new practices.

It only applies already-promoted active practices when their `applies_when` condition matches the current work.

Runtime reading is strict:

1. check `status`
2. skip deprecated blocks
3. check `applies_when`
4. use `goal` to interpret the practice
5. apply `do` as the default move
6. use `avoid` as the competing-pattern guard

If there are no active relevant practices, Codex continues without CSBP runtime guidance.

No active match means no forced behavior.

## 🧪 Practice formation

Practice formation starts only when the operator asks for it.

That can happen in two common ways:

### 💬 From an operator observation

The operator notices a recurring issue and asks Codex whether it belongs in CSBP.

Codex checks the pattern against the compiler rules, then proposes, revises, splits, narrows, or rejects the candidate.

### 🔍 From session review

After a block of work, the operator asks Codex to review the session for possible recurring practices.

Codex may propose candidates.

It does not promote them by itself.

### ✅ Promotion path

A typical path:

1. operator raises or asks for a candidate
2. Codex evaluates recurrence, scope, actionability, and authority
3. the candidate is normalized into runtime block shape
4. weak or local material is rejected
5. valid material is proposed
6. the operator approves or rejects
7. only approved practice enters `shared-best-practice.txt`

The final `PNNN` id is assigned only at promotion.

## 🚫 What stays out

CSBP is not a place to store every useful thought.

Material stays out when it is:

- one-off
- project-specific
- session-specific
- vague
- diagnostic-only
- recovery-only
- policy-like
- explanation-like
- already covered by `AGENTS.md`
- already covered by local instructions
- dependent on hidden or unstable context
- only an operator preference without stable operational need

This filter is part of the system.

CSBP is useful because it says no.

## 🏛️ Authority

CSBP is lower-authority than the operating contract around it.

```text
operator instruction > AGENTS.md > local project instructions or project-local guidance > CSBP
```

CSBP never overrides higher-authority instructions.

If a CSBP practice conflicts with operator instruction, `AGENTS.md`, or local project guidance, the conflicting CSBP item is not applied.

Runtime practices do not define policy.

Runtime practices do not define scope.

Runtime practices do not define authority.

## 🔌 Compatibility

If CSBP is your persistent best-practice layer, avoid running it alongside automatic memory systems that can also turn session carryover into future behavior.

That includes Codex Memories if they are being used for the same job.

Two persistence layers create unclear authority.

CSBP is meant to keep persistence explicit, reviewed, and operator-approved.

## 🛎️ When to change what

Change `shared-best-practice.txt` only when a practice has passed through formation or maintenance and the operator has approved the action.

Do not change, rewrite, or extend:

- `CSBP-entry-point.txt`
- `shared-best-practice-compiler.txt`

Those are fixed system-definition layers.

Runtime practice changes belong in `shared-best-practice.txt`.

## 🧱 System model

CSBP is a layered protocol system, not a single instruction file and not a memory dump.

| Layer | File | Operational role | Mutable at runtime | Read timing |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 🚪 Bootstrap layer | `CSBP-entry-point.txt` | Defines system identity, authority order, load order, mode routing, and write restrictions. | No | First |
| 📌 Runtime layer | `shared-best-practice.txt` | Stores already-promoted practices that may guide live work when relevant. | Yes, but only through compiler path and operator approval. | After bootstrap |
| 🧪 Compiler layer | `shared-best-practice-compiler.txt` | Governs formation, evaluation, normalization, promotion, revision, deprecation, removal, and rejection. | No during normal runtime. | Only during practice formation work |

## ⚙️ Core mechanical principle

The protocol keeps three jobs separate:

| Job | Description | Why separation matters |
|---|---|---|
| Define the system | Explain what CSBP is, how it is loaded, and what authority it has. | Prevents the runtime layer from redefining the system. |
| Apply promoted practices | Use only already-approved runtime instructions when relevant. | Prevents speculative or draft guidance from becoming active behavior. |
| Form or revise practices | Evaluate whether a recurring pattern deserves promotion. | Prevents discussion and drafting logic from leaking into normal operation. |

If these jobs are mixed together, CSBP stops being a controlled best-practice layer and starts behaving like an unstable second contract.

## 🧭 Load order

Runtime path:

```text
CSBP-entry-point.txt
shared-best-practice.txt
```

Formation path:

```text
CSBP-entry-point.txt
shared-best-practice.txt
shared-best-practice-compiler.txt
```

The compiler is not loaded into normal runtime behavior.

## 🔀 Mode separation

| Mode | Primary file | Purpose | Can do | Must not do |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Runtime mode | `shared-best-practice.txt` | Apply already-promoted practices. | Guide decisions when `applies_when` matches. | Invent, revise, promote, deprecate, or remove practices silently. |
| Practice formation mode | `shared-best-practice-compiler.txt` | Evaluate and shape candidate practices. | Propose promotion, revision, deprecation, rejection, or removal. | Auto-promote without approval or behave as active runtime policy. |

## 🧾 Runtime practice block

Each promoted runtime practice uses this fixed shape:

| Field | Meaning | Runtime function |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Sequential identifier in `PNNN` form. | Stable reference. |
| `status` | `active` or `deprecated`. | Determines runtime eligibility. |
| `scope` | `global` or `environment-global`. | Signals breadth of relevance. |
| `kind` | `environment`, `orientation`, `operation`, or `verification`. | Helps interpret the practice role. |
| `applies_when` | Operational condition. | Decides whether the practice is relevant now. |
| `goal` | Intended operational effect. | Explains the purpose. |
| `do` | Preferred default action. | Main instruction to apply. |
| `avoid` | Competing failure pattern. | Guard against regression. |

Deprecated entries are excluded from runtime use, but can remain available for review and maintenance history.

## 📌 Scope and kind

Scope values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `global` | Stable across work contexts. |
| `environment-global` | Stable across the current working environment across sessions. |

Kind values:

| Value | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `environment` | Stable environment condition, constraint, or affordance. |
| `orientation` | Setup, framing, or initial approach. |
| `operation` | Execution step or working method during real work. |
| `verification` | Check, confirmation, or closure practice. |

## ✅ Admission criteria

A candidate is admitted only when it is:

- recurring across sessions
- global or environment-global
- actionable during real work
- preventive by default
- expressible as a short operational instruction
- stable across work contexts
- not already covered by `AGENTS.md`
- not already covered by stronger local instruction
- likely to reduce recurring waste or error

## 🚫 Rejection criteria

Reject material that is:

- project-specific
- session-specific
- one-off
- vague
- diagnostic-only
- recovery-only
- post-failure only
- duplicate
- too broad to match reliably
- too narrow to matter outside one case
- in conflict with higher-authority instructions
- dependent on hidden or unstable context
- explanation instead of instruction
- policy instead of operational correction

## 🧹 Normalization

Candidate practices should be rewritten as:

- preventive defaults
- runtime-ready instructions
- one pattern per practice
- short stable wording
- direct verbs

Remove:

- narrative
- non-operational explanation
- project-specific detail
- fallback phrasing
- recovery-first phrasing

## ♻️ Lifecycle

```text
candidate  -> evaluate -> normalize -> promote | reject
active     -> revise
active     -> deprecate
deprecated -> remove
```

Removal requires direct operator instruction.

Runtime maintenance uses the compiler protocol and requires operator approval.

## 📝 Proposal shape

Formation proposals use this shape:

```text
candidate:      short description of the pattern
kind:           environment | orientation | operation | verification
scope:          global | environment-global
rationale:      one short operational sentence
proposed block: full block shape draft
```

The `id` is left unassigned until operator-approved promotion.

## 🧯 Conflict handling

CSBP is explicitly lower-authority than:

```text
operator instruction
AGENTS.md
local project instructions or project-local guidance
```

If a CSBP item conflicts with any of those, the CSBP item is not applied.

CSBP does not create new policy authority for itself.

## ✍️ Manual maintenance

Manual maintenance is allowed if the operator follows the documented block shape and promotion rules.

Manual does not mean casual.

The same admission, rejection, normalization, authority, and approval constraints still apply.
